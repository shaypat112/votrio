            Software development changed faster than security did. AI
            assistants made it possible for a two-person team to ship what
            used to take a department — but the review process for that code
            still assumes a human wrote every line and had time to think
            about it.

            <span className="text-foreground">We started Votrio because that gap is only going to widen.</span>{" "}
            The teams moving fastest right now are also the most exposed, and
            most of them don&apos;t know it yet — not because they&apos;re
            careless, but because nothing built for the old pace of shipping
            can keep up with the new one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Votrio exists so that shipping fast and shipping secure stop
            being a trade-off. That&apos;s the whole bet.
